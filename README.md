# Odin - Rock Paper Scissors

## An implementation of grade-school classic "rock paper scissors" game played from the browser console

This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations Course (JavaScript Basics) to practice all of the JavsScript knowledge I have acquired. This project shows how to do the following:
 
 * Implement a function that randomly returns 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
 * Implement a function that evaluates a single round of Rock Paper Scissors
 * Implement a function that conducts a five-round game, keeping track of scores and declaring a winner or loser at the end
 * Obtain user input using `prompt()`
 * Display text in the browser's console using `console.log()`
